          <p>The Neureal Foundation is proud to introduce the “Founder’s Edition,” Ethereum backed collector’s cards. These limited-edition cards prove your place as the earliest adopters of blockchain based AI. Your contribution to the Neureal Foundation will be carved in blockchain. Immortalize yourself with the ownership of one-of-a-kind, 3 dimensional art created by the Numina artificial intelligence. Each card is unique, meticulously designed and serialized with nothing less than the traditional standard and foil card method used in the most popular card games. These cards are first come first serve, and they will run out quickly.</p>

              <p>Data scientists worldwide now have a standing hypothesis of what consciousness really is. Numina is an artificial intelligence designed to mimic, and predict, the consciousness and intention of the human user. This open source technology is the root of prediction into our human condition. Instead of programmatic basic fixes to real-world problems, the user builds a relationship through positive reinforcement and teaches solutions to real-world problems. It is the most advanced solution humans have to the possibility of transcendence; and with conservative optimism, it is the ability to watch our bodies die.</p>

              <p>One of the most popular uses of a decentralized mass AI is obviously going to be financial markets. The average Bloomberg subscription can cost as much as $0.11 per second. It is one of the most expensive software subscriptions known to mankind, but it is merely a compilation of publicly available information. Nascent is an AI designed by some of the world’s leading financial AI experts to do two things: Get ALL the information and make ALL the money.</p>
              <p>Empowered by the Neureal artificial intelligence, Nascent harnesses the computations of the world's most powerful supercomputer, the decentralized blockchain. Being rich usually comes in a close second to immortality. That is why you also have the ability to contribute (and use) the most powerful crypto trading AI in the world.</p>

              <p>Hurricanes are one of the most destructive natural forces that exist. The deaths and damage they cause are also among the most preventable if only people have enough time and enough warning.
